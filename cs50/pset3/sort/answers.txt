sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: when program is run with sorted50000.txt it takes significantly less time than when it run with file reversed50000.txt
                  so in bubble sort big omega is (n) and for worst case big O is (n^2) which indicates the differance in both the cases
                  and shows it is a bubble sort

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: when sort2 code is run with all 3 files of 50000 text its gives almost same time in every condition which
                  signifies that it is either a merge sort or selection sort as both have equal values for individual big omega
                  and big O values. but sort2 gives low runtime than programe 3 for bigger set of (n).
                  Which proves merge sort

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: as sort3 run with sorted, reversed and random files text it gives almost equal runtime but that runtime is
                 significantly greater than runtime of sort2 which proves that this is Selection sort which has equal big omega
                 value and big O value.
